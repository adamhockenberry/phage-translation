These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7–38\% of ‘unknown’ sequence space in viromes. Genome- and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus–host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes.},

In addition, hundreds of circular DNA elements that do not encode any discernable similarities to previously characterized sequences were identified. To characterize these ‘dark matter’ sequences, we used an artificial neural network to identify candidate viral capsid proteins, several of which formed virus-like particles when expressed in culture.

	abstract = {Due to their dependence on cellular organisms for metabolism and replication, viruses are typically named and assigned to species according to their genome structure and the original host that they infect. But because viruses often infect multiple hosts and the numbers of distinct lineages within a host can be vast, their delineation into species is often dictated by arbitrary sequence thresholds, which are highly inconsistent across lineages. Here we apply an approach to determine the boundaries of viral species based on the detection of gene flow within populations, thereby defining viral species according to the biological species concept (BSC). Despite the potential for gene transfer between highly divergent genomes, viruses, like the cellular organisms they infect, assort into reproductively isolated groups and can be organized into biological species. This approach revealed that BSC-defined viral species are often congruent with the taxonomic partitioning based on shared gene contents and host tropism, and that bacteriophages can similarly be classified in biological species. These results open the possibility to use a single, universal definition of species that is applicable across cellular and acellular lifeforms.},

	abstract = {Rapidly thawing permafrost harbors ϳ30 to 50\% of global soil carbon, and the fate of this carbon remains unknown. Microorganisms will play a central role in its fate, and their viruses could modulate that impact via induced mortality and metabolic controls. Because of the challenges of recovering viruses from soils, little is known about soil viruses or their role(s) in microbial biogeochemical cycling. Here, we describe 53 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs]) recovered from seven quantitatively derived (i.e., not multiple-displacement-ampliﬁed) viral-particle metagenomes (viromes) along a permafrost thaw gradient at the Stordalen Mire ﬁeld site in northern Sweden. Only 15\% of these vOTUs had genetic similarity to publicly available viruses in the RefSeq database, and ϳ30\% of the genes could be annotated, supporting the concept of soils as reservoirs of substantial undescribed viral genetic diversity. The vOTUs exhibited distinct ecology, with different distributions along the thaw gradient habitats, and a shift from soil-viruslike assemblages in the dry palsas to aquatic-virus-like assemblages in the inundated fen. Seventeen vOTUs were linked to microbial hosts (in silico), implicating viruses in infecting abundant microbial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, including those encoding key biogeochemical functions such as organic matter degradation. Thirty auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identiﬁed and suggested virus-mediated modulation of central carbon metabolism, soil organic matter degradation, polysaccharide binding, and regulation of sporulation. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that these soil viruses have distinct ecology, impact hostmediated biogeochemistry, and likely impact ecosystem function in the rapidly changing Arctic.},

In this study, we analyzed 1,600 (1,352 nonredundant) complete double-stranded DNA viral genomes (10 to 211 kb) assembled from 52 marine viromes. Together with 244 previously reported uncultured viral genomes, a genome-wide comparison delineated 617 genuslevel operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for these environmental viral genomes (EVGs). Of these, 600 OTUs contained no representatives from known viruses, thus putatively corresponding to novel viral genera. Predicted hosts of the EVGs included major groups of marine prokaryotes, such as marine group II Euryarchaeota and SAR86, from which no viruses have been isolated to date, as well as Flavobacteriaceae and SAR116. Our analysis indicates that marine cyanophages are already well represented in genome databases and that one of the EVGs likely represents a new cyanophage lineage. Several EVGs encode many enzymes that appear to function for an efﬁcient utilization of iron-sulfur clusters or to enhance host survival. This suggests that there is a selection pressure on these marine viruses to accumulate genes for speciﬁc viral propagation strategies. Finally, we revealed that EVGs contribute to a 4-fold increase in the recruitment of photic-zone viromes compared with the use of current reference viral genomes.},

	abstract = {Rapid turnover of mobile elements drives the plasticity of bacterial genomes. Integrated bacteriophages (prophages) encode host-adaptive traits and represent a sizable fraction of bacterial chromosomes. We hypothesized that natural selection shapes prophage integration patterns relative to the host genome organization. We tested this idea by detecting and studying 500 prophages of 69 strains of Escherichia and Salmonella. Phage integrases often target not only conserved genes but also intergenic positions, suggesting purifying selection for integration sites. Furthermore, most integration hotspots are conserved between the two host genera. Integration sites seem also selected at the large chromosomal scale, as they are nonrandomly organized in terms of the origin–terminus axis and the macrodomain structure. The genes of lambdoid prophages are systematically co-oriented with the bacterial replication fork and display the host high frequency of polarized FtsK-orienting polar sequences motifs required for chromosome segregation. matS motifs are strongly avoided by prophages suggesting counter selection of motifs disrupting macrodomains. These results show how natural selection for seamless integration of prophages in the chromosome shapes the evolution of the bacterium and the phage. First, integration sites are highly conserved for many millions of years favoring lysogeny over the lytic cycle for temperate phages. Second, the global distribution of prophages is intimately associated with the chromosome structure and the patterns of gene expression. Third, the phage endures selection for DNA motifs that pertain exclusively to the biology of the prophage in the bacterial chromosome. Understanding prophage genetic adaptation sheds new lights on the coexistence of horizontal transfer and organized bacterial genomes.},

Although conventionally defined as AG-rich motifs, recent genomic surveys reveal great sequence diversity, questioning how SD functions. Here, we determined the molecular fitness (i.e., translation efficiency) of 49 synthetic 9-nt SD genotypes in three distinct mRNA contexts in Escherichia coli. We uncovered generic principles governing the SD fitness landscapes: (1) Guanine contents, rather than canonical SD motifs, best predict the fitness of both synthetic and endogenous SD; (2) the genotype-fitness correlation of SD promotes its evolvability by steadily supplying beneficial mutations across fitness landscapes; and (3) the frequency and magnitude of deleterious mutations increase with background fitness, and adjacent nucleotides in SD show stronger epistasis. Epistasis results from disruption of the continuous base pairing between SD and rRNA. This “chain-breaking” epistasis creates sinkholes in SD fitness landscapes and may profoundly impact the evolution and function of prokaryotic translation initiation and other RNA-mediated processes. Collectively, our work yields functional insights into the SD sequence variation in prokaryotic genomes, identifies a simple design principle to guide bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis of SD, and illuminates the fundamentals of fitness landscapes and molecular evolution.},

However, detailed secondary structural features governing protein abundance remain elusive. Recent advances in high-throughput DNA synthesis and experimental systems enable us to obtain large amounts of data. Here, we evaluated six types of structural features using two large-scale datasets. We found that accessibility, which is the probability that a given region around the start codon has no base-paired nucleotides, showed the highest correlation with protein abundance in both datasets. Accessibility showed a signiﬁcantly higher correlation (Spearman’s ␳ = 0.709) than the widely used minimum free energy (0.554) in one of the datasets. Interestingly, accessibility showed the highest correlation only when it was calculated by a log-linear model, indicating that the RNA structural model and how to utilize it are important. Furthermore, by combining the accessibility and activity of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, we devised a method for predicting protein abundance more accurately than existing methods. We inferred that the log-linear model has a broader probabilistic distribution than the widely used Turner energy model, which contributed to more accurate quantiﬁcation of ribosome accessibility to translation initiation sites.},

However, recent studies strongly suggest that the efficiency of protein synthesis is additionally regulated by multiple factors that impact the elongation phase. To assess the influence of early elongation on protein synthesis, we employed a library of more than 250,000 reporters combined with in vitro and in vivo protein expression assays. Here we report that the identity of the amino acids encoded by codons 3 to 5 impact protein yield. This effect is independent of tRNA abundance, translation initiation efficiency, or overall mRNA structure. Single-molecule measurements of translation kinetics revealed pausing of the ribosome and aborted protein synthesis on codons 4 and 5 of distinct amino acid and nucleotide compositions. Finally, introduction of preferred sequence motifs only at specific codon positions improves protein synthesis efficiency for recombinant proteins. Collectively, our data underscore the critical role of early elongation events in translational control of gene expression.},

Domestication of their components is thought to have endowed bacteria with molecular systems involved in secretion, defense, warfare, and gene transfer. However, the rates and mechanisms of domestication remain unknown. We used comparative genomics to study the evolution of prophages within the bacterial genome. We identified over 300 vertically inherited prophages within enterobacterial genomes. Some of these elements are very old and might predate the split between Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The size distribution of prophage elements is bimodal, suggestive of rapid prophage inactivation followed by much slower genetic degradation. Accordingly, we observed a pervasive pattern of systematic counterselection of nonsynonymous mutations in prophage genes. Importantly, such patterns of purifying selection are observed not only on accessory regions but also in core phage genes, such as those encoding structural and lysis components. This suggests that bacterial hosts select for phage-associated functions. Several of these conserved prophages have gene repertoires compatible with described functions of adaptive prophage-derived elements such as bacteriocins, killer particles, gene transfer agents, or satellite prophages. We suggest that bacteria frequently domesticate their prophages. Most such domesticated elements end up deleted from the bacterial genome because they are replaced by analogous functions carried by new prophages. This puts the bacterial genome in a state of continuous flux of acquisition and loss of phage-derived adaptive genes.},

Using quantitative proteomics and RNA sequencing, we explore the molecular basis of attenuation in a strain of bacteriophage T7 whose major capsid gene was engineered to carry 182 suboptimal codons. We do not detect transcriptional effects from recoding. Proteomic observations reveal that translation is halved for the recoded major capsid gene, and a more modest reduction applies to several coexpressed downstream genes. We observe no changes in protein abundances of other coexpressed genes that are encoded upstream. Viral burst size, like capsid protein abundance, is also decreased by half. Together, these observations suggest that, in this virus, reduced translation of an essential polycistronic transcript and diminished virion assembly form the molecular basis of attenuation.},

We demonstrate the method using bacteriophage øX174, the first DNA genome to be sequenced. Like many well-studied natural organisms, closely related genome sequences are available—23 Bullavirinae genomes related to øX174. Using bioinformatic tools, we first identified 315 potential open reading frames (ORFs) within the genome, including the 11 established essential genes and 82 highly conserved ORFs that have no known gene products or assigned functions. Using genome-scale design and synthesis, we made a mutant genome in which all 11 essential genes are simultaneously disrupted, leaving intact only the 82 conserved but cryptic ORFs. The resulting genome is not viable. Cell-free gene expression followed by mass spectrometry revealed only a single peptide expressed from both the cryptic ORF and wild-type genomes, suggesting a potential new gene. A second synthetic genome in which 71 conserved cryptic ORFs were simultaneously disrupted is viable but with ∼50\% reduced fitness relative to the wild type. However, rather than finding any new genes, repeated evolutionary adaptation revealed a single point mutation that modulates expression of gene H, a known essential gene, and fully suppresses the fitness defect. Taken together, we conclude that the annotation of currently functional ORFs for the øX174 genome is formally complete. More broadly, we show that sequencing and bioinformatics followed by synthesis-enabled reverse genomics, proteomics, and evolutionary adaptation can definitely establish the sufficiency and completeness of natural genome annotations.},

A given protein abundance can be obtained from infinitely many combinations of these rates. This raises the question of whether the natural rates for each gene result from historical accidents, or are there rules that give certain combinations a selective advantage? We address this question using high-throughput measurements in rapidly growing cells from diverse organisms to find that about half of the rate combinations do not exist: genes that combine high transcription with low translation are strongly depleted. This depletion is due to a trade-off between precision and economy: high transcription decreases stochastic fluctuations but increases transcription costs. Our theory quantitatively explains which rate combinations are missing, and predicts the curvature of the fitness function for each gene. It may guide the design of gene circuits with desired expression levels and noise.},

Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth12. We experimentally measured the growth burden13,14 due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost–benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

When Escherichia coli expresses the lac operon, it needs to balance the potential increase in growth rate conferred through having the encoded proteins (which help it to take up and metabolize lactose) with the potential reduction in growth rate because of the resources needed to express and fold the encoded proteins. To investigate these inherent tradeoffs, Eames and Kortemme (p. 911) investigated the costs and benefits associated with the lac operon and surprisingly found that the main constraint on the system is not caused by the manufacture of the proteins themselves but by the lactose permease activity encoded by the LacY gene.
Cells must balance the cost and benefit of protein expression to optimize organismal fitness. The lac operon of the bacterium Escherichia coli has been a model for quantifying the physiological impact of costly protein production and for elucidating the resulting regulatory mechanisms. We report quantitative fitness measurements in 27 redesigned operons that suggested that protein production is not the primary origin of fitness costs. Instead, we discovered that the lac permease activity, which relates linearly to cost, is the major physiological burden to the cell. These findings explain control points in the lac operon that minimize the cost of lac permease activity, not protein expression. Characterizing similar relationships in other systems will be important to map the impact of cost/benefit tradeoffs on cell physiology and regulation.
A close look at a paradigmatic system accounts for the costs due to protein activity versus expression and folding.

Our approach is largely consistent with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, with 72 and 89\% congruence at the subfamily and genus levels, respectively. Discrepancies could be attributed to misclassifications and a small number of highly mosaic genera confounding the phylogenetic signal. We also show that confidently resolved nodes in the concatenated protein tree are highly reproducible across different software and models, and conclude that the approach can serve as a framework for a rank-normalized taxonomy of most tailed double-stranded DNA viruses.},

Within protein-coding regions, the redundancy of the genetic code can, in principle, allow for the overlapping encoding of signals in addition to the amino acid sequence, but it is not known to what extent genomes exploit this potential and, if so, for what purpose. Here, we systematically explore whether protein-coding regions accommodate overlapping codes, by comparing the number of occurrences of each possible short sequence within the protein-coding regions of over 700 species from viruses to plants, to the same number in randomizations that preserve amino acid sequence and codon bias. We find that coding regions across all phyla encode additional information, with bacteria carrying more information than eukaryotes. The detailed signals consist of both known and potentially novel codes, including position-dependent secondary RNA structure, bacteria-specific depletion of transcription and translation initiation signals, and eukaryote-specific enrichment of microRNA target sites. Our results suggest that genomes may have evolved to encode extensive overlapping information within protein-coding regions.},

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate protein synthesis is crucial for organismal survival in competitive environments. Translation efficiency (the number of proteins translated from a single mRNA in a given time period) is the combined result of differential translation initiation, elongation, and termination rates. Previous research identified the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence as a modulator of translation initiation in bacterial genes, while codon usage biases are frequently implicated as a primary determinant of elongation rate variation. Recent studies have suggested that SD sequences within coding sequences may negatively affect translation elongation speed, but this claim remains controversial. Here, we present a metric to quantify the prevalence of SD sequences in coding regions. We analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes and find that the coding sequences of highly expressed genes systematically contain fewer SD sequences than expected, yielding a robust correlation between the normalized occurrence of SD sites and protein abundances across a range of bacterial taxa. We further show that depletion of SD sequences within ribosomal protein genes is correlated with organismal growth rates, supporting the hypothesis of strong selection against the presence of these sequences in coding regions and suggesting their association with translation efficiency in bacteria.},

	abstract = {It is generally believed that prokaryotic translation is initiated by the interaction between the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the 5′ UTR of an mRNA and the anti-SD sequence in the 3′ end of a 16S ribosomal RNA. However, there are two exceptional mechanisms, which do not require the SD sequence for translation initiation: one is mediated by a ribosomal protein S1 (RPS1) and the other used leaderless mRNA that lacks its 5′ UTR. To understand the evolutionary changes of the mechanisms of translation initiation, we examined how universal the SD sequence is as an effective initiator for translation among prokaryotes. We identified the SD sequence from 277 species (249 eubacteria and 28 archaebacteria). We also devised an SD index that is a proportion of SD-containing genes in which the differences of GC contents are taken into account. We found that the SD indices varied among prokaryotic species, but were similar within each phylum. Although the anti-SD sequence is conserved among species, loss of the SD sequence seems to have occurred multiple times, independently, in different phyla. For those phyla, RPS1-mediated or leaderless mRNA-used mechanisms of translation initiation are considered to be working to a greater extent. Moreover, we also found that some species, such as Cyanobacteria, may acquire new mechanisms of translation initiation. Our findings indicate that, although translation initiation is indispensable for all protein-coding genes in the genome of every species, its mechanisms have dynamically changed during evolution.},

To compute SD sequence conservation, we used SD motif sequences predicted by Tompa and systematically aligned them with 5′UTR sequences. We found that there exists a clear correlation between the CAI values and SD sequence conservation in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Methanococcus jannaschii, and no relationship is found in M. genitalium, M. pneumoniae, and Synechocystis. That is, genes with higher CAI values tend to have more conserved SD sequences than do genes with lower CAI values in these organisms.

Genes with AUG start codons are more likely than genes with other start codons, GUG or UUG, to possess an SD sequence.

	abstract = {In prokaryotes, Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequences, nucleotides upstream from start codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are complementary to ribosomal RNA (rRNA), facilitate the initiation of protein synthesis. The location of SD sequences relative to start codons and the stability of the hybridization between the mRNA and the rRNA correlate with the rate of synthesis. Thus, accurate characterization of SD sequences enhances our understanding of how an organism's transcriptome relates to its cellular proteome. We implemented the Individual Nearest Neighbor Hydrogen Bond model for oligo–oligo hybridization and created a new metric, relative spacing (RS), to identify both the location and the hybridization potential of SD sequences by simulating the binding between mRNAs and single-stranded 16S rRNA 3′ tails. In 18 prokaryote genomes, we identified 2,420 genes out of 58,550 where the strongest binding in the translation initiation region included the start codon, deviating from the expected location for the SD sequence of five to ten bases upstream. We designated these as RS+1 genes. Additional analysis uncovered an unusual bias of the start codon in that the majority of the RS+1 genes used GUG, not AUG. Furthermore, of the 624 RS+1 genes whose SD sequence was associated with a free energy release of less than −8.4 kcal/mol (strong RS+1 genes), 384 were within 12 nucleotides upstream of in-frame initiation codons. The most likely explanation for the unexpected location of the SD sequence for these 384 genes is mis-annotation of the start codon. In this way, the new RS metric provides an improved method for gene sequence annotation. The remaining strong RS+1 genes appear to have their SD sequences in an unexpected location that includes the start codon. Thus, our RS metric provides a new way to explore the role of rRNA–mRNA nucleotide hybridization in translation initiation.},

However, more leaderless bacteria and archaea mRNAs are being increasingly reported in recent years. To understand the distribution of SD-led genes and non-SD-led genes, we have analyzed 162 completed prokaryotic genomes leading to various new conclusions and validations of previous smaller scale studies. The fact that the number of the SD-led genes among those genomes varies from 11.6\% to 90.8\% implies that the populations of non-SD-led genes as well as leaderless genes are significant. We found that there is a strong SD conserved region in genomes with high proportion of SD-led genes. Following a t-test we showed that SD sequence content (SDSC) has no correlation with GC content. We observed that the closely related phylogenetic microbes mostly possess a similar SDSC value, and archaeal nonleading genes possess higher SDSC. This study shows that the 5′UTR of prokaryotic genes are highly diverse, particularly when genomes of distantly related organisms are compared, suggesting that more flexible mechanisms are used for translation initiation process in various prokaryotes.},

Eighteen out of the 20 amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons. While synonymous codons are clearly equivalent in terms of the information they carry, it is now well established that they are used in a biased fashion. There is currently no consensus as to the origin of this bias. Drawing on ideas from stochastic thermodynamics we derive from first principles a mathematical model describing the statistics of codon usage bias. We show that the model accurately describes the distribution of codon usage bias of genomes in the fungal and bacterial kingdoms.

	abstract = {Variation in synonymous codon usage is abundant across multiple levels of organization: between codons of an amino acid, between genes in a genome, and between genomes of different species. It is now well understood that variation in synonymous codon usage is influenced by mutational bias coupled with both natural selection for translational efficiency and genetic drift, but how these processes shape patterns of codon usage bias across entire lineages remains unexplored. To address this question, we used a rich genomic data set of 327 species that covers nearly one third of the known biodiversity of the budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. We found that, while genome-wide relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for all codons was highly correlated with the GC content of the third codon position (GC3), the usage of codons for the amino acids proline, arginine, and glycine was inconsistent with the neutral expectation where mutational bias coupled with genetic drift drive codon usage. Examination between genes’ effective numbers of codons and their GC3 contents in individual genomes revealed that nearly a quarter of genes (381,174/1,683,203; 23\%), as well as most genomes (308/327; 94\%), significantly deviate from the neutral expectation. Finally, by evaluating the imprint of translational selection on codon usage, measured as the degree to which genes’ adaptiveness to the tRNA pool were correlated with selective pressure, we show that translational selection is widespread in budding yeast genomes (264/327; 81\%). These results suggest that the contribution of translational selection and drift to patterns of synonymous codon usage across budding yeasts varies across codons, genes, and genomes; whereas drift is the primary driver of global codon usage across the subphylum, the codon bias of large numbers of genes in the majority of genomes is influenced by translational selection.},

The traditional methylation/deamination/mutation hypothesis for the rarity of CG does not adequately account for the observed deficiencies in certain sequences, notably the mitochondrial genomes, yeast, and Neurospora crassa, which lack the standard CpG methylase. Homodinucleotides (AA.TT, CC.GG) and larger homooligonucleotides are over-represented in many organisms, perhaps due to polymerase slippage events. For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences. The CCA.TGG triplet is ubiquitously over-represented in human viral and eukaryotic sequences. Among the tetranucleotides, several four-base-pair palindromes tend to be under-represented in phage sequences, probably as a means of restriction avoidance. The tetranucleotide CTAG is observed to be rare in virtually all bacterial genomes and some phage genomes.

	abstract = {Because binding of RNAP to misplaced sites could compromise the efficiency of transcription, natural selection for the optimization of gene expression should regulate the distribution of DNA motifs capable of RNAP-binding across the genome. Here we analyze the distribution of the −10 promoter motifs that bind the σ70 subunit of RNAP in 42 bacterial genomes. We show that selection on these motifs operates across the genome, maintaining an over-representation of −10 motifs in regulatory sequences while eliminating them from the nonfunctional and, in most cases, from the protein coding regions. In some genomes, however, −10 sites are over-represented in the coding sequences; these sites could induce pauses effecting regulatory roles throughout the length of a transcriptional unit. For nonfunctional sequences, the extent of motif under-representation varies across genomes in a manner that broadly correlates with the number of tRNA genes, a good indicator of translational speed and growth rate. This suggests that minimizing the time invested in gene transcription is an important selective pressure against spurious binding. However, selection against spurious binding is detectable in the reduced genomes of host-restricted bacteria that grow at slow rates, indicating that components of efficiency other than speed may also be important. Minimizing the number of RNAP molecules per cell required for transcription, and the corresponding energetic expense, may be most relevant in slow growers. These results indicate that genome-level properties affecting the efficiency of transcription and translation can respond in an integrated manner to optimize gene expression. The detection of selection against promoter motifs in nonfunctional regions also confirms previous results indicating that no sequence may evolve free of selective constraints, at least in the relatively small and unstructured genomes of bacteria.},

	abstract = {Synonymous rare codons are considered to be sub-optimal for gene expression because they are translated more slowly than common codons. Yet surprisingly, many protein coding sequences include large clusters of synonymous rare codons. Rare codons at the 5’ terminus of coding sequences have been shown to increase translational efficiency. Although a general functional role for synonymous rare codons farther within coding sequences has not yet been established, several recent reports have identified rare-to-common synonymous codon substitutions that impair folding of the encoded protein. Here we test the hypothesis that although the usage frequencies of synonymous codons change from organism to organism, codon rarity will be conserved at specific positions in a set of homologous coding sequences, for example to tune translation rate without altering a protein sequence. Such conservation of rarity–rather than specific codon identity–could coordinate co-translational folding of the encoded protein. We demonstrate that many rare codon cluster positions are indeed conserved within homologous coding sequences across diverse eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal species, suggesting they result from positive selection and have a functional role. Most conserved rare codon clusters occur within rather than between conserved protein domains, challenging the view that their primary function is to facilitate co-translational folding after synthesis of an autonomous structural unit. Instead, many conserved rare codon clusters separate smaller protein structural motifs within structural domains. These smaller motifs typically fold faster than an entire domain, on a time scale more consistent with translation rate modulation by synonymous codon usage. While proteins with conserved rare codon clusters are structurally and functionally diverse, they are enriched in functions associated with organism growth and development, suggesting an important role for synonymous codon usage in organism physiology. The identification of conserved rare codon clusters advances our understanding of distinct, functional roles for otherwise synonymous codons and enables experimental testing of the impact of synonymous codon usage on the production of functional proteins.},

Since nonfunctional DNA binding can be detrimental to cellular functions and ultimately to organismal fitness, organisms could benefit from reducing the number of nonfunctional DNA binding sites genome wide. Using in vitro measurements of binding affinities for a large collection of DNA binding proteins, in multiple species, we detect a significant global avoidance of weak binding sites in genomes. We demonstrate that the underlying evolutionary process leaves a distinct genomic hallmark in that similar words have correlated frequencies, a signal that we detect in all species across domains of life. We consider the possibility that natural selection against weak binding sites contributes to this process, and using an evolutionary model we show that the strength of selection needed to maintain global word compositions is on the order of point mutation rates. Likewise, we show that evolutionary mechanisms based on interference of protein-DNA binding with replication and mutational repair processes could yield similar results and operate with similar rates. On the basis of these modeling and bioinformatic results, we conclude that genome-wide word compositions have been molded by DNA binding proteins acting through tiny evolutionary steps over time scales spanning millions of generations.},

We survey the complete genomes of 340 species for signals of reduced mRNA secondary structure near the start codon. Our analysis includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, insects, fishes, birds, and mammals. We find that nearly all species show evidence for reduced mRNA stability near the start codon. The reduction in stability generally increases with increasing genomic GC content. In prokaryotes, the reduction also increases with decreasing optimal growth temperature. Within genomes, there is variation in the stability among genes, and this variation correlates with gene GC content, codon bias, and gene expression level. For birds and mammals, however, we do not find a genome-wide trend of reduced mRNA stability near the start codon. Yet the most GC rich genes in these organisms do show such a signal. We conclude that reduced stability of the mRNA secondary structure near the start codon is a universal feature of all cellular life.

It is widely believed that synonymous codons are translated with unequal speeds and that translational efficiency is maximized by the exclusive use of rapidly translated codons. Here we estimate the in vivo translational speeds of all sense codons from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, preferentially used codons are not translated faster than unpreferred ones. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is a result of codon usage in proportion to cognate tRNA concentrations, the optimal strategy in enhancing translational efficiency under tRNA shortage. Our predicted codon–tRNA balance is indeed observed from all model eukaryotes examined, and its impact on translational efficiency is further validated experimentally. Our study reveals a previously unsuspected mechanism by which unequal codon usage increases translational efficiency, demonstrates widespread natural selection for translational efficiency, and offers new strategies to improve synthetic biology.},

To investigate how, we engineered a synthetic library of 154 genes that varied randomly at synonymous sites, but all encoded the same green fluorescent protein (GFP). When expressed in Escherichia coli, GFP protein levels varied 250-fold across the library. GFP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, mRNA degradation patterns, and bacterial growth rates also varied, but codon bias did not correlate with gene expression. Rather, the stability of mRNA folding near the ribosomal binding site explained more than half the variation in protein levels. In our analysis, mRNA folding and associated rates of translation initiation play a predominant role in shaping expression levels of individual genes, whereas codon bias influences global translation efficiency and cellular fitness.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen intensive progress in measuring protein translation. However, the contributions of coding sequences to the efficiency of the process remain unclear. Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first ∼30–50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last ∼50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow “ramp” at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression.

	abstract = {Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. These synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency: in every organism, some codons are used more commonly, while others are more rare. Though the encoded protein sequence is identical, selective pressures favor more common codons for enhanced translation speed and fidelity. However, rare codons persist, presumably due to neutral drift. Here, we determine whether other, unknown factors, beyond neutral drift, affect the selection and/or distribution of rare codons. We have developed a novel algorithm that evaluates the relative rareness of a nucleotide sequence used to produce a given protein sequence. We show that rare codons, rather than being randomly scattered across genes, often occur in large clusters. These clusters occur in numerous eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and are not confined to unusual or rarely expressed genes: many highly expressed genes, including genes for ribosomal proteins, contain rare codon clusters. A rare codon cluster can impede ribosome translation of the rare codon sequence. These results indicate additional selective pressures govern the use of synonymous codons, and specifically that local pauses in translation can be beneficial for protein biogenesis.},

Statistical approaches are confronted with small genome sizes forbidding significant single-phage analysis, and comparative methods analyzing full phage genomes represent an alternative but they are of difficult interpretation due to lateral gene transfer, which creates a mosaic spectrum of related phage species. Based on a large-scale codon bias analysis of 116 DNA phages hosted by 11 translationally biased bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic families, we observe that phage genomes are almost always under codon selective pressure imposed by translationally biased hosts, and we propose a classification of phages with translationally biased hosts which is based on adaptation patterns. We introduce a computational method for comparing phages sharing homologous proteins, possibly accepted by different hosts. We observe that throughout phages, independently from the host, capsid genes appear to be the most affected by host translational bias. For coliphages, genes involved in virion morphogenesis, host interaction and ssDNA binding are also affected by adaptive pressure. Adaptation affects long and small phages in a significant way. We analyze in more detail the Microviridae phage space to illustrate the potentiality of the approach. The small number of directions in adaptation observed in phages grouped around ϕX174 is discussed in the light of functional bias. The adaptation analysis of the set of Microviridae phages defined around ϕMH2K shows that phage classification based on adaptation does not reflect bacterial phylogeny.},

Although alternative theories abound, translational selection has been accepted as an important mechanism that shapes the patterns of codon usage in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes. Here we analyze patterns of codon usage across 74 diverse bacteriophages that infect E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and L. lactis as their primary host. We use the concept of a “genome landscape,” which helps reveal non-trivial, long-range patterns in codon usage across a genome. We develop a series of randomization tests that allow us to interrogate the significance of one aspect of codon usage, such as GC content, while controlling for another aspect, such as adaptation to host-preferred codons. We find that 33 phage genomes exhibit highly non-random patterns in their GC3-content, use of host-preferred codons, or both. We show that the head and tail proteins of these phages exhibit significant bias towards host-preferred codons, relative to the non-structural phage proteins. Our results support the hypothesis of translational selection on viral genes for host-preferred codons, over a broad range of bacteriophages.},

Current machine learning approaches to predicting virus host interactions have a tendency to focus on nucleotide features, ignoring other representations of genomic information. Here we investigate the predictive potential of features generated from four different ‘levels’ of viral genome representation: nucleotide, amino acid, amino acid properties and protein domains. This more fully exploits the biological information present in the virus genomes. Over a hundred and eighty binary datasets for infecting versus non-infecting viruses at all taxonomic ranks of both eukaryote and prokaryote hosts were compiled. The viral genomes were converted into the four different levels of genome representation and twenty feature sets were generated by extracting k-mer compositions and predicted protein domains. We trained and tested Support Vector Machine, SVM, classifiers to compare the predictive capacity of each of these feature sets for each dataset. Our results show that all levels of genome representation are consistently predictive of host taxonomy and that prediction k-mer composition improves with increasing k-mer length for all k-mer based features. Using a phylogenetically aware holdout method, we demonstrate that the predictive feature sets contain signals reflecting both the evolutionary relationship between the viruses infecting related hosts, and host-mimicry. Our results demonstrate that incorporating a range of complementary features, generated purely from virus genome sequences, leads to improved accuracy for a range of virus host prediction tasks enabling computational assignment of host taxonomic information.},

However, many previously unappreciated potential open reading frames become apparent in the expression analysis, revealing an unexpected complexity in the pattern of lambda gene function.},

	abstract = {Viruses are integral components of all ecosystems and microbiomes on Earth. Through pervasive infections of their cellular hosts, viruses can reshape microbial community structure and drive global nutrient cycling. Over the past decade, viral sequences identified from genomes and metagenomes have provided an unprecedented view of viral genome diversity in nature. Since 2016, the IMG/VR database has provided access to the largest collection of viral sequences obtained from (meta)genomes. Here, we present the third version of IMG/VR, composed of 18 373 cultivated and 2 314 329 uncultivated viral genomes (UViGs), nearly tripling the total number of sequences compared to the previous version. These clustered into 935 362 viral Operational Taxonomic Units (vOTUs), including 188 930 with two or more members. UViGs in IMG/VR are now reported as single viral contigs, integrated proviruses or genome bins, and are annotated with a new standardized pipeline including genome quality estimation using CheckV, taxonomic classification reflecting the latest ICTV update, and expanded host taxonomy prediction. The new IMG/VR interface enables users to efficiently browse, search, and select UViGs based on genome features and/or sequence similarity. IMG/VR v3 is available at https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr, and the underlying data are available to download at https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/IMG\_VR.},

	abstract = {Because phages use their host translation machinery, their codon usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure codon adaptation of phages to their host, rRSCU (the correlation in relative synonymous codon usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation bias, so only phages parasitizing Escherichia coli were included in the analysis. For double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages, both rRSCU and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer RNA genes encoded by the phage genome. rRSCU is greater for dsDNA phages than for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages, and the low rRSCU values are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU values for Y-ending codons between ssDNA phages and the E. coli host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation bias in the ssDNA phages. Strong C→T mutation bias would improve codon adaptation in codon families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending codons are favored over C-ending codons (“U-friendly” codon families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease codon adaptation in other codon families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending codons against U-ending codons (“U-hostile” codon families). It is remarkable that ssDNA phages with increasing C→T mutation bias also increased the usage of codons in the “U-friendly” codon families, thereby achieving CAI values almost as large as those of dsDNA phages. This represents a new type of codon adaptation.},

	abstract = {Microbial minimal generation times range from a few minutes to several weeks. They are evolutionarily determined by variables such as environment stability, nutrient availability, and community diversity. Selection for fast growth adaptively imprints genomes, resulting in gene amplification, adapted chromosomal organization, and biased codon usage. We found that these growth-related traits in 214 species of bacteria and archaea are highly correlated, suggesting they all result from growth optimization. While modeling their association with maximal growth rates in view of synthetic biology applications, we observed that codon usage biases are better correlates of growth rates than any other trait, including rRNA copy number. Systematic deviations to our model reveal two distinct evolutionary processes. First, genome organization shows more evolutionary inertia than growth rates. This results in over-representation of growth-related traits in fast degrading genomes. Second, selection for these traits depends on optimal growth temperature: for similar generation times purifying selection is stronger in psychrophiles, intermediate in mesophiles, and lower in thermophiles. Using this information, we created a predictor of maximal growth rate adapted to small genome fragments. We applied it to three metagenomic environmental samples to show that a transiently rich environment, as the human gut, selects for fast-growers, that a toxic environment, as the acid mine biofilm, selects for low growth rates, whereas a diverse environment, like the soil, shows all ranges of growth rates. We also demonstrate that microbial colonizers of babies gut grow faster than stabilized human adults gut communities. In conclusion, we show that one can predict maximal growth rates from sequence data alone, and we propose that such information can be used to facilitate the manipulation of generation times. Our predictor allows inferring growth rates in the vast majority of uncultivable prokaryotes and paves the way to the understanding of community dynamics from metagenomic data.},

We developed linear and nonlinear models to estimate the C→T mutation bias in different phage lineages and to evaluate the relative effect of mutation and host selection on phage codon usage. C→T-biased mutations occur more frequently in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages than in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages and affect not only synonymous codon usage, but also nonsynonymous substitutions at second codon positions, especially in ssDNA phages. The host translation machinery affects codon adaptation in both dsDNA and ssDNA phages, with a stronger effect on dsDNA phages than on ssDNA phages.

We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance.

	abstract = {Codon usage bias exerts control over a wide variety of molecular processes. The positioning of synonymous codons within coding sequences (CDSs) dictates protein expression by mechanisms such as local translation efficiency, mRNA Gibbs free energy, and protein cotranslational folding. In this work, we explore how codon usage affects the position-dependent content of hydrogen bonding, which in turn influences energy requirements for unwinding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We categorized codons according to their hydrogen bond content and found differential effects on hydrogen bonding encoded by codon variants. The specific positional disposition of codon variants within CDSs creates a ramp of hydrogen bonding at the 5ʹ end of the ORFeome in Escherichia coli. CDSs occupying the first position of operons are subjected to selective pressure that reduces their hydrogen bonding compared to internal CDSs, and highly transcribed CDSs demand a lower maximum capacity of hydrogen bonds per codon, suggesting that the energetic requirement for unwinding the dsDNA in highly transcribed CDSs has evolved to be minimized in E. coli. Subsequent analysis of over 14,000 ORFeomes showed a pervasive ramp of hydrogen bonding at the 5ʹ end in Bacteria and Archaea that positively correlates with the probability of mRNA secondary structure formation. Both the ramp and the correlation were not found in Fungi. The position-dependent hydrogen bonding might be part of the mechanism that contributes to the coordination between transcription and translation in Bacteria and Archaea. A Web-based application to analyze the position-dependent hydrogen bonding of ORFeomes has been developed and is publicly available (https://juanvillada.shinyapps.io/hbonds/).
IMPORTANCE Redundancy of the genetic code creates a vast space of alternatives to encode a protein. Synonymous codons exert control over a variety of molecular and physiological processes of cells mainly through influencing protein biosynthesis. Recent findings have shown that synonymous codon choice affects transcription by controlling mRNA abundance, mRNA stability, transcription termination, and transcript biosynthesis cost. In this work, by analyzing thousands of Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi genomes, we extend recent findings by showing that synonymous codon choice, corresponding to the number of hydrogen bonds in a codon, can also have an effect on the energetic requirements for unwinding double-stranded DNA in a position-dependent fashion. This report offers new perspectives on the mechanism behind the transcription-translation coordination and complements previous hypotheses on the resource allocation strategies used by Bacteria and Archaea to manage energy efficiency in gene expression.},

However, the extent and generality of fitness effects resulting from cotranslational folding remain open questions. Here we report a genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for cotranslational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify loci within genes that are both significantly enriched in slowly translated codons and evolutionarily conserved. Surprisingly, we find that domain boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead, we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated with cotranslational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of cotranslational folding account for the majority of these loci across more than 500 Escherichia coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding, this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes. More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a biological context.},

Here, we identify numerous genetic transfers between distantly related phages and aim at understanding their frequency, consequences and the conditions favoring them. Gene flow tends to occur between phages that are enriched for recombinases, transposases and non-homologous end joining, suggesting that both homologous and illegitimate recombination contribute to gene flow. Phage family and host phyla are strong barriers to gene exchange, but phage lifestyle is not. We observe more exchanges between temperate phages even if they tend to have smaller genomes. These acquisitions often include transcription regulators and lysins. Yet, there is also extensive gene flow between temperate and virulent phages, or between the latter. These predominantly involve virulent phages with large genomes previously classed as low gene flux, and lead to the preferential transfer of genes encoding functions involved in cell energetics, nucleotide metabolism, DNA packaging and injection, and virion assembly. Such exchanges may explain the acquisition of genes in virulent phages, which tend to have the largest genomes. We used genetic transfers, which occur upon co-infection of a host, to compare phage host range. We found that virulent phages have broader host ranges and mediate genetic exchanges between narrow host range temperate phages infecting distant bacterial hosts, thus contributing to gene flow between virulent phages, as well as between temperate phages. This gene flow drastically expands the gene repertoires available for phage and bacterial evolution, including the transfer of functional innovations across taxa.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The optimal location of aSD sequence binding relative to the start codon, the full extents of the aSD sequence and the functional form of the relationship between aSD sequence complementarity and translation efficiency have not been fully resolved. Here, we investigate these relationships by leveraging the sequence diversity of endogenous genes and recently available genome-wide estimates of translation efficiency. We show that—after accounting for predicted mRNA structure—aSD sequence complementarity increases the translation of endogenous mRNAs by roughly 50\%. Further, we observe that this relationship is nonlinear, with translation efficiency maximized for mRNAs with intermediate levels of aSD sequence complementarity. The mechanistic insights that we observe are highly robust: we find nearly identical results in multiple datasets spanning three distantly related bacteria. Further, we verify our main conclusions by re-analysing a controlled experimental dataset.},

Existing models have focused on how RNA folding energetics control translation initiation rate under equilibrium conditions but have largely ignored the effects of nonequilibrium RNA folding. We introduce a new mechanism, called “ribosome drafting”, that explains how a mRNA’s folding kinetics and the ribosome’s binding rate collectively control its translation initiation rate. During cycles of translation, ribosome drafting emerges whenever successive ribosomes bind to a mRNA faster than the mRNA can refold, maintaining it in a nonequilibrium state with an acceleration of protein synthesis. Using computational design, time-correlated single photon counting, and expression measurements, we demonstrate that slow-folding and fast-folding RNA structures with equivalent folding energetics can vary protein synthesis rates by 1000-fold. We determine the necessary conditions for ribosome drafting by characterizing mRNAs with rationally designed ribosome binding rates, folding kinetics, and folding energetics, confirming the predictions of a nonequilibrium Markov model of translation. Our results have widespread implications, illustrating how competitive folding and assembly kinetics can shape the gene expression machinery’s sequence–structure–function relationship inside cells.},

	abstract = {Summary: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.Availability:http://cd-hit.org.Contact:liwz@sdsc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Members of this phylum naturally lack Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequences in their mRNA, and yet their ribosomes retain the conserved anti-SD sequence. Translation initiation is tuned by mRNA secondary structure and by the identities of several key nucleotides upstream of the start codon. Positive determinants include adenine at position –3, reminiscent of the Kozak sequence of Eukarya. Comparative analysis of Escherichia coli reveals use of the same Kozak-like sequence to enhance initiation, suggesting an ancient and widespread mechanism. Elimination of contacts between A-3 and the conserved β-hairpin of ribosomal protein uS7 fails to diminish the contribution of A-3 to initiation, suggesting an indirect mode of recognition. Also, we find that, in the Bacteroidetes, the trinucleotide AUG is underrepresented in the vicinity of the start codon, which presumably helps compensate for the absence of SD sequences in these organisms.},

Here, we show that ribosomes purified from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a representative of the Bacteroidetes, fail to recognize the SD sequence of mRNA in vitro. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the complete 70S ribosome from F. johnsoniae at 2.8 Å resolution reveals that the ASD is sequestered by ribosomal proteins bS21, bS18 and bS6, explaining the basis of ASD inhibition. The structure also uncovers a novel ribosomal protein—bL38. Remarkably, in F. johnsoniae and many other Flavobacteriia, the gene encoding bS21 contains a strong SD, unlike virtually all other genes. A subset of Flavobacteriia have an alternative ASD, and in these organisms the fully complementary sequence lies upstream of the bS21 gene, indicative of natural covariation. In other Bacteroidetes classes, strong SDs are frequently found upstream of the genes for bS21 and/or bS18. We propose that these SDs are used as regulatory elements, enabling bS21 and bS18 to translationally control their own production.},

	abstract = {Abstract Translation of mRNAs into proteins is a key cellular process. Ribosome binding sites and stop codons provide signals to initiate and terminate translation, while stable secondary mRNA structures can induce translational recoding events. Fluorescent proteins are commonly used to characterize such elements but require the modification of a part's natural context and allow only a few parameters to be monitored concurrently. Here, we combine Ribo-seq with quantitative RNA-seq to measure at nucleotide resolution and in absolute units the performance of elements controlling transcriptional and translational processes during protein synthesis. We simultaneously measure 779 translation initiation rates and 750 translation termination efficiencies across the Escherichia coli transcriptome, in addition to translational frameshifting induced at a stable RNA pseudoknot structure. By analyzing the transcriptional and translational response, we discover that sequestered ribosomes at the pseudoknot contribute to a σ32-mediated stress response, codon-specific pausing, and a drop in translation initiation rates across the cell. Our work demonstrates the power of integrating global approaches toward a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of gene regulation and burden in living cells.},

	abstract = {The unequal utilization of synonymous codons affects numerous cellular processes including translation rates, protein folding and mRNA degradation. In order to understand the biological impact of variable codon usage bias (CUB) between genes and genomes, it is crucial to be able to accurately measure CUB for a given sequence. A large number of metrics have been developed for this purpose, but there is currently no way of systematically testing the accuracy of individual metrics or knowing whether metrics provide consistent results. This lack of standardization can result in false-positive and false-negative findings if underpowered or inaccurate metrics are applied as tools for discovery. Here, we show that the choice of CUB metric impacts both the significance and measured effect sizes in numerous empirical datasets, raising questions about the generality of findings in published research. To bring about standardization, we developed a novel method to create synthetic protein-coding DNA sequences according to different models of codon usage. We use these benchmark sequences to identify the most accurate and robust metrics with regard to sequence length, GC content and amino acid heterogeneity. Finally, we show how our benchmark can aid the development of new metrics by providing feedback on its performance compared to the state of the art.},

While proteome-wide quantification is not yet fully routine, many datasets approaching proteome-wide coverage are becoming available through biophysical and MS techniques. Data of this type can be accessed via a variety of sources, including publication supplements and online data repositories. However, access to the data is still fragmentary, and comparisons across experiments and organisms are not straightforward. Here, we describe recent updates to our database resource “PaxDb” (Protein Abundances Across Organisms). PaxDb focuses on protein abundance information at proteome-wide scope, irrespective of the underlying measurement technique. Quantification data is reprocessed, unified, and quality-scored, and then integrated to build a meta-resource. PaxDb also allows evolutionary comparisons through precomputed gene orthology relations. Recently, we have expanded the scope of the database to include cell-line samples, and more systematically scan the literature for suitable datasets. We report that a significant fraction of published experiments cannot readily be accessed and/or parsed for quantitative information, requiring additional steps and efforts. The current update brings PaxDb to 414 datasets in 53 organisms, with (semi-) quantitative abundance information covering more than 300 000 proteins.},

	abstract = {Transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) is a high-throughput method coupling transposon mutagenesis with short-fragment DNA sequencing. It is commonly used to identify essential genes. Single gene deletion libraries are considered the gold standard for identifying essential genes. Currently, the TraDIS method has not been benchmarked against such libraries, and therefore, it remains unclear whether the two methodologies are comparable. To address this, a high-density transposon library was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12. Essential genes predicted from sequencing of this library were compared to existing essential gene databases. To decrease false-positive identification of essential genes, statistical data analysis included corrections for both gene length and genome length. Through this analysis, new essential genes and genes previously incorrectly designated essential were identified. We show that manual analysis of TraDIS data reveals novel features that would not have been detected by statistical analysis alone. Examples include short essential regions within genes, orientation-dependent effects, and fine-resolution identification of genome and protein features. Recognition of these insertion profiles in transposon mutagenesis data sets will assist genome annotation of less well characterized genomes and provides new insights into bacterial physiology and biochemistry.
IMPORTANCE Incentives to define lists of genes that are essential for bacterial survival include the identification of potential targets for antibacterial drug development, genes required for rapid growth for exploitation in biotechnology, and discovery of new biochemical pathways. To identify essential genes in Escherichia coli, we constructed a transposon mutant library of unprecedented density. Initial automated analysis of the resulting data revealed many discrepancies compared to the literature. We now report more extensive statistical analysis supported by both literature searches and detailed inspection of high-density TraDIS sequencing data for each putative essential gene for the E. coli model laboratory organism. This paper is important because it provides a better understanding of the essential genes of E. coli, reveals the limitations of relying on automated analysis alone, and provides a new standard for the analysis of TraDIS data.},

Many genes could be associated with a specific condition because the gene affected fitness only in that condition, or with another gene in the same bacterium because they had similar mutant phenotypes. Of the poorly annotated genes, 2,316 had associations that have high confidence because they are conserved in other bacteria. By combining these conserved associations with comparative genomics, we identified putative DNA repair proteins; in addition, we propose specific functions for poorly annotated enzymes and transporters and for uncharacterized protein families.
