Successfully stepping through the necessary code (a numbered series of `.ipynb` notebooks located in `Code/` will require downloading the [required dataset from zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4708008) and extracting the contents so that a `Data` folder exists in the base directory.

Full sequences were downloaded from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?VirusLineage_ss=Bacteriophage,%20all%20taxids&SeqType_s=Nucleotide&Completeness_s=complete on May 14, 2020.
